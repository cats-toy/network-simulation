 <h1>Tools Used</h1>

  1. VMware workstation
  2. EVE-NG
 
<h1>EVE-NG</h1>
<p>EVE-NG is a powerful network emulation and virtualization software. It's mainly used to create network topologies on server for learning and testing purposes</p>
<p>EVE-NG is mainly used for:<br>
- Proof of concept <br>
- Network Automation<br>
- Troubleshooting<br>
- Experimentation</p>
<p>In this project, I'll use EVE-NG to recreate some network topologies used in real life networks. I'll be applying various network concepts such as WAN/SD-WAN to connect multiple sites to each other, subnetting and VLANs to separate network interfaces and routing tables.</p>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>The ISO for the EVE-NG community version can be installed here, <a href="https://www.eve-ng.net/index.php/download/#DL-LIN">EVE-NG Downloads</a></p>
<p>EVE-NG is compatible with VMware version 16 and later. The VMware can be installed here, <a href="https://support.broadcom.com/">VMware Broadcom.</a> For VMware, you'll need to register for an account with Broadcom. In software, click on VMware Cloud Foundation, My Downloads and then install VMware workstation version 16.0.0. </p>
